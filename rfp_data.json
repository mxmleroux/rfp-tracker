    "description": "ECW, on behalf of and in coordination with Cheshire West and Chester, Cheshire East, and Warrington Borough Councils, is seeking to appoint consultancy support to produce a Cheshire and Warrington Outline Energy Plan;  providing the evidence base to support  local growth ambitions and investment pipeline development, support future spatial development work in Cheshire and Warrington, and support engagement in the NESO Regional Energy Strategic Planning (RESP) process. This commission will provide a strong local evidence base for current and future demand, and build the case for investment in energy infrastructure to support both local growth ambitions and commitments in our Sustainable and Inclusive Economic Strategy to support the local energy transition and government ambitions for Clean Power by 2030.\r\n\r\nClean Energy is one vital component of Cheshire and Warrington growth ambitions, with unique existing (e.g. VisNet, Gas Storage Facilities) and upcoming (e.g. HyNet, HALEU) infrastructure providing substantial opportunities for us to pioneer approaches to clean power and industrial decarbonisation. This infrastructure will support wider growth opportunities, ensuring that Cheshire and Warrington is an attractive location for housing growth, business development, and reindustrialisation.  To better grasp this opportunity, it is vital we:\r\n1.\tBetter understand our baseline energy demand.\r\n2.\tHave access to light-touch scenario planning to anticipate the likely changes to generation and demand over the next 5-10 years.\r\n3.\tCan clearly and consistently produce early evidence for RESP, DSO, and NGET to secure strategic reinforcement to grid.\r\n4.\tUnderstand the integration of different energy transition vectors across the C&W landscape.\r\n5.\tCan drive investment to strategically vital energy projects in Cheshire and Warrington that support wider economic development.\r\nThis commission will provide the foundation for attracting inward investment in Cheshire and Warrington",

    "description": "Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC) are currently exploring options for the future procurement of a Sandwell Wrap Around Service. The primary objective of this service is to reduce hospital delays, prevent unnecessary long-term care placements, improve independence outcomes, and provide coordinated, person-centred support that enables multidisciplinary assessment and intervention to take place in appropriate settings.\r\n      \r\n      The service will deliver a wrap-around model of care, offering 24-hour care and support where required, alongside agreed multidisciplinary team input, for individuals awaiting assessments or longer-term care provision. Support will be tailored to individual need and a safe transition of care.\r\n      \r\n      The service will be provided for people whose assessed level of need can be safely and effectively supported outside of an acute hospital environment and where those needs may not be appropriately met within the individual's own home or usual place of residence without additional coordinated support.\r\n      \r\n      The Sandwell Wrap Around Service will help maintain capacity within the Borough of Sandwell for a short-term, up to 72 hour period, supporting hospital avoidance for individuals living in the community. The service will support people who are medically stable but require further assessment, monitoring, or intervention before a long-term care decision is made.\r\n      \r\n      Eligibility for the service will include adults aged 18 years and over who are residents of Sandwell.\r\n      \r\n      This preliminary market engagement seeks to understand supplier capabilities and challenges, gather feedback, and inform the development of the future procurement of the Sandwell Wrap Around Service.\r\n      \r\n      This will take place on Wednesday 4 March 10am - 11am for all interested organisations.\r\n       \r\n      Please email by Monday 2 March 11am rupi_deo@sandwell.gov.uk your full name, job title, organisation, email address",

The initial contract value is estimated at £800,000 (excl.

This support will be required on an ad hoc and project-specific basis, complementing the legal advice currently obtained through the Government Legal Department.\r\n\r\nThe Supplier will be expected to provide expertise in foreign, corporate, and commercial law, particularly in areas where DESNZ lacks specialist legal expertise or capacity through the Government Legal Department. This includes drafting legally binding contracts and funding arrangements governed by foreign law, advising on complex commercial or financial investment vehicles, and providing guidance on non-legally binding arrangements with international organisations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Supplier will provide knowledge sharing - and develop guidance documentation in cases of common issues - for DESNZ staff on common legal issues. This will enable DESNZ staff to make informed assessments of legal risk when drafting project business cases or amendments to template terms and conditions, prior to review by the Supplier or the Government Legal Department. The Supplier will also provide updates on upcoming changes in law affecting ICF programmes.",

    "description": "\"The planned introduction of longer train services to the Airport in response to future demand growth will mean that double stacking arrangements of trains as currently used will no longer be viable. Through the project's Delivery Steering Group, Northern and TransPennine Express have carried out analysis which has identified that additional platform capacity is needed at the airport in order to realise the full benefit of longer train services serving the airport.\r\n      \r\n      The scheme is part of a package of proposed measures in the Manchester area that are being designed/planned to boost capacity and resilience, emanating from the Cross Manchester Capacity and Reliability Improvement Study. Improving the operation of train services in the centre of Manchester and providing further capacity at Manchester Airport station, aligns with the strategic aims of Network Rail, TfGM, TfN and the wider industry.  This project in in Tranche 1 of the Manchester and North West Transformation Programme (MNTP):\r\n       \r\n      A remodelling of the station at Manchester Airport, specifically a platform addition or extension of multiple platforms, or provision of a new turnback facility, will be essential to accommodate the planned implementation of longer rolling stock services.\r\n           \r\n      The redevelopment of these platforms will enable permissive working of two 6x24m (144m) trains, in two of the four platforms at the Airport Station. This will allow for the unaltered retention of all existing TOC services both originating and terminating at the Airport Station under 'double-stacking' conditions.\r\n      \r\n      The scope areas for this package are as follows:\r\n      •  Electrical install ready for Electricty North West power connection for cabin installation\r\n      •  Lighting cable diversion works and any survey works in associated with this\r\n      •  Installing lights on the cabins/storage areas\r\n      •  Lights on the hoarding at woodhouse lane\r\n      •  Install P",
